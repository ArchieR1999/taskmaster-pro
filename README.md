## Functionality
This app functions as a more capable Kanban board. It has 4 columns and two buttons. 
- to start, press the 'add task' button on the left of the page. It will open a menu for data input which will be the task name. After, in order to save a task, a date must be picked.
- after the save task button is clicked, the task gets populated in the 'to-do' column. From there, it can be dragged among any of the four columns, edited by clicked on the date to pick the date or by clicking the input field which will allow the task name to be edited. The order of the tasks can also be selected if the user has multiple items in one of the columns.
- the board can be cleared by clicking the 'delete all tasks' button below the 'add task' button which we intially went over.
- Lastly, when dragging, we can see the bottom of the page gets a delete function. If a task is dragged to the bottom of the page, the task will be deleted when drag is released.
